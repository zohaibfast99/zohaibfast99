## 🚀 About Me

I’m a curious and self‑driven learner who enjoys understanding how systems work — from writing clean code to deploying and scaling applications in real environments.

My goal is to **bridge the gap between software development and infrastructure automation**, building systems that are not only functional but also **scalable, secure, and efficient**.

I strongly believe in *learning by building*. Most of my repositories reflect hands‑on experimentation with web applications and backend services.
